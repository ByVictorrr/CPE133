2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PAR_GEN/FSM/count[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) PAR_GEN/EVENT_CNTR/count_reg[0]/CLR, PAR_GEN/EVENT_CNTR/count_reg[1]/CLR, PAR_GEN/EVENT_CNTR/count_reg[2]/CLR, PAR_GEN/EVENT_CNTR/count_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
